      <i class="far fa-address-card" /> About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
      I have spent my first 17 years of my working career in a financial role. I
      have subsequently spent 8 months <br /> developing my skills as a FULL
      STACK WEB DEVELOPER.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have developed a broad range of skills in web development, and this
      together with my vast business and <br />management experience I trust
      will put my skillset in a category of its own.
